For every result the m/z differences between both samples are matched against rules, for pos and neg ion. If two ions match, the ion annotations are changed (previous annotation is wrong), confirmed or added. Returns the peaklist from one ion mode with recalculated annotations so I repeat to be able to jump between modes.
